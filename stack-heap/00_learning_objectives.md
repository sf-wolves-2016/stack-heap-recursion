Learning objectives:
  - Understand scope and how objects are passed
  - More familiarity with common data structures
  - Problem solving using data structures



queue - FIFO
stack - LIFO

queue.pop()
queue.peek()
queue.enqueue(1)

arr.shift - O(1) - constant
arr.first - O(1) - constant
arr << 1 - O(1)

arr.pop - O(1)
arr.last - O(1)
arr << 1 - O(1)


(on the order of) how many operations will this function take given an input of size n
O(n) - linear








Outline
  - Stack vs Heap
    - call stack/scoping
    - variables on the stack, the things they reference in heap
    - drawing memory diagrams
    - object_id
    - assigning to a variable points it somewhere else
  - Data Structures
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - different ways to declare each
    - Nested structures
  - Choosing a data structure to fit a task
    - Markov models
  - If there's time (there probably won't be), additional data structures
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Linked Lists
    - Trees
    - Graphs (nodes and edges)
    - Least recently used cache
