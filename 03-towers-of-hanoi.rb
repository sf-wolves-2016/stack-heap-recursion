# Towers of Hanoi is a classic recursion puzzle:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi
# (spoiler alert, that page contains a solution)
# You have a tower of disks of different sizes on one peg, and want to move all
# the disks from one peg to another without ever putting a disk on top of a
# smaller disk.  There are three pegs total -- the one the disks are currently
# on (the source peg), the one you want to move them to (the destination peg)
# and one additional peg.

# Here we're representing the three pegs as arrays, disks as numbers (indicating
# their sizes), and identifying which peg is the source, which is the
# destination, and which is the extra as their indices in the array.

# Note that we have an additional parameter -- current_level, which represents
# how deep of a pile we're currently interested in moving.
# Consider this a hint!
require 'rspec'

# The method should return the number of moves required to solve the puzzle
def towers_of_hanoi(towers, current_level, source, destination, other)
    return 0 if current_level == 0
    # move current_level - 1 disks from source to other
    steps = towers_of_hanoi(towers, current_level - 1, source, other, destination)
    # move the disk on top of source to destination
    towers[destination] << towers[source].pop
    steps += 1
    # move current_level - 1 disks from other to destination
    steps += towers_of_hanoi(towers, current_level - 1, other, destination, source)
end

# towers = [[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [], []]
# p towers_of_hanoi(towers, 7, 0, 1, 2)
# p towers
